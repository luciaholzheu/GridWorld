Set 7:

1. The methods that are implemented in Critter are act, getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocations, make move.

2. The five basic actions to all critters are getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocations and makeMove

3. Yes because the sub classes will have different variations to what actors are defined as, so they would respond with flower, bug, critter etc.

4. It could change to that actors color, remove the actor or move it out of the way.

5. getMoveLocations, makeMove, and selectMoveLocation. The critter would first check to see the surrounding open adjacent positions and then select where to move and then actually move, its a 3 step process for it to move around.

6. There is no critter consturctor because critter extends to actor and actor has the constructor already in it so you do not have to write a constructor for it.

Set 8:

1. The chameleon critter overrides processActors and makeMove which are both in act, therefore changing the way the chameleon acts.

2.
