Set 7:

1. The methods that are implemented in Critter are act, getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocations, make move.

2. The five basic actions to all critters are getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocations and makeMove

3. Yes because the sub classes will have different variations to what actors are defined as, so they would respond with flower, bug, critter etc.

4. It could change to that actors color, remove the actor or move it out of the way.

5. getMoveLocations, makeMove, and selectMoveLocation. The critter would first check to see the surrounding open adjacent positions and then select where to move and then actually move, its a 3 step process for it to move around.

6. There is no critter consturctor because critter extends to actor and actor has the constructor already in it so you do not have to write a constructor for it.

Set 8:

1. The chameleon critter overrides processActors and makeMove which are both in act, therefore changing the way the chameleon acts.

2. It calls super.makeMove to call all uses of makeMove to the current critter so they can be processed and used to face the chamelon a certain direction.

3. You could take its old location or previous location and make it create a new flower when it move to the next space.

4. The chameleon does not need to figure out which actor is which, it just selects a random one and moves towards it and changes color.

5. Actor

6. The critter can call getGrid and access the grid for its use.

Set 9: 

1. The bug does not need to process the actors when it can just use getActors to see where they are and then what to do.

2. The crab critter will eat anything to its direct front-left, front and front-right. It will not eat rocks or another critter.

3. It is used to bring in an array of directions that the critter can then use to make a move or eat another something.

4. 4,3  4,4  4,5

5. Crab critters can only move left and right unless there is something it can eat directly in front of it and critters do not turn when they cant move.

6.If the crab can only move to the spot it currently is (being blocked by other objects) it will turn.

7. Crabs will not eat any other type of critter declared in its processActors.
